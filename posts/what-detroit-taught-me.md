excerpt: Thirty years of Lions football is not a tragedy. It's a masterclass in unconditional loyalty — and what it means to show up when it costs you something.

I want to tell you about the 2008 Detroit Lions.

They went 0-16. Every game. Every week. There was no moral victory, no close-loss narrative to soften it, no promising rookie to project your hope onto. They just lost — repeatedly, consistently, and without ambiguity — for an entire NFL season.

I watched most of those games.

Not because I thought they might turn it around. Not because I was documenting something historically bad for posterity. I watched because they were the Lions, and watching was what you did.

## The Unconditional Part

There's a version of sports fandom that's essentially a financial transaction. You invest attention and enthusiasm; the team returns wins and championships. When the returns dry up, you adjust your portfolio. Bandwagon fans operate on this model, and I don't think they're wrong exactly — it's just a different relationship than the one I have.

Detroit fandom isn't a transaction. It's closer to being from somewhere.

You don't stop being from Detroit because the city is going through something. You don't re-examine your identity every time the Lions go 0-16 or the Tigers finish last. The relationship was never contingent on performance.

This sounds like stubbornness. From the outside, it probably is. But there's something that gets built in the process of unconditional loyalty that conditional loyalty never produces: the ability to show up when showing up costs you something.

## What You Learn From Losing

The Wings dynasty spoiled a generation of Detroit fans in the best possible way. From 1997 to 2002, we won four Stanley Cups. We watched Yzerman and Fedorov and Lidstrom do things that didn't seem physically possible. We expected to win because we usually did.

Then it ended. And then came the Lions seasons. And then the Tigers losing streaks. And then the Pistons rebuild.

What you learn — over thirty years of losing more than you win — is that identity isn't a scoreboard. The Lions are the Lions whether they're 0-16 or 15-2. I'm a Lions fan in both scenarios. The city is still Detroit.

This is not a comfortable thing to hold. It requires separating who you are from how things are going, which is genuinely difficult and not something anyone teaches you explicitly.

But once you can do it in sports, you can do it everywhere.

## The Transfer

The best leaders I've seen operate this way. They're not cheerful when things are bad. They're not in denial about the scoreboard. But their identity — their sense of who they are and what they're building — doesn't fluctuate with the quarter's results.

They're loyal to the thing the way Detroit fans are loyal to the Lions. Not because the results have been good. Because it's theirs.

That's a different kind of leader than one who's great when things are great and uncertain when they're not.

Detroit taught me how to be the first kind.
