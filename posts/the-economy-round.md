excerpt: What CS taught me about resource management, when to spend, and why the round after a loss is the most important one you'll play.

There's a moment in Counter-Strike that every experienced player knows. You just lost a round you should have won. Your team has $800 each. The other side is fully bought — rifles, armor, grenades, utilities. You have pistols.

Most players want to force. Buy what you can, throw it at the wall, hope something sticks.

The disciplined play is to save. Lose intentionally. Preserve your economy so that two rounds from now, you're buying rifles again instead of another half-buy that puts you behind for the next three.

This is called an economy round. And I think about it constantly outside of the game.

## The Resource State Nobody Admits

Most decisions get made without an honest accounting of the current resource state. Organisations announce projects they don't have the bandwidth to execute. People commit to timelines built on best-case assumptions. Money gets spent on a half-buy when the correct call is to save and reload.

The Counter-Strike economy system forces you to confront this. You can see exactly how much you have. You can see exactly what your opponents have. The buy decision is unavoidable and consequential — you make it at the start of every round.

In real life, those accountings are optional. Most people skip them.

## Losing Intentionally

The hardest thing to internalise about economy rounds is that you're choosing to lose the round. Not because you're giving up. Because you're playing for a position that doesn't exist yet.

This requires two things most people don't have in combination: the discipline to accept a short-term loss and the confidence that the math works in your favour over a longer horizon.

When I see someone — or an organisation — spending resources they don't have on a problem they can't solve right now, I think: they don't trust the economy round. They'd rather force and lose two rounds down 5v5 than save and win the next three at full buy.

## The Tell

You can spot this in meetings. Someone will propose an initiative that's clearly under-resourced. Someone else will point out the gap. The response is almost always a variation of: *we'll figure it out as we go.*

That's a force-buy. Sometimes it works. Usually it doesn't, and when it doesn't, the team is broken and half-bought going into the next round too.

The better call — always — is to be honest about what you have, what the opponent has, and whether this is the right round to spend.

Save. Reload. Win the next three.
