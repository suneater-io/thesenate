excerpt: Why I built this site, what the Senate actually means, and why I finally started writing.

I've been meaning to write for a long time.

Not blog-post writing. Not thought-leadership writing. Just — writing. The kind where you work something out by putting it down, where the process of explaining a thing helps you understand it better than you did before you started.

The Senate started as a metaphor I used to explain myself to people who asked why I was interested in so many unrelated things. Music and architecture. Counter-Strike and mythology. Vintage sportswear and AI infrastructure.

The answer I kept landing on was that they weren't unrelated. They just looked that way from the outside.

## What the Senate Actually Is

Every interest, hobby, and obsession occupies a seat in the chamber. They debate. They cross-pollinate. They build on each other. The Norse mythology seat talks to the architecture seat because both are obsessed with structure and fate. The Counter-Strike seat talks to the AI seat because both are obsessed with information asymmetry and real-time decision-making under pressure.

When you stop treating your interests as separate silos and start treating them as a legislature, something changes. You stop apologizing for the range. You start noticing the connections.

That's the Senate. A system for thinking, not just a collection of hobbies.

## Why I'm Writing Here

This site was built to show the Senate — not hide it. Most portfolios flatten everything into a professional veneer. They pick the one thing that's safe to show and lead with that.

I don't think that's honest, and I don't think it's useful.

So I built a place where the full chamber is on display. And I figured if the chamber is already out there, I might as well use this space to document what's happening inside it.

Some of what I write here will be technical. Some will be philosophical. Some will be about basketball cards or Havamal verses or why certain Counter-Strike maps are architecturally brilliant.

All of it will be from the Senate.
